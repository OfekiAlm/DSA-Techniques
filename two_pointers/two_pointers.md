# two pointers
The two pointers technique is a common algorithmic strategy used in computer science to solve a variety of problems, particularly those involving arrays or linked lists. It involves maintaining two pointers, which can move towards each other, away from each other, or in the same direction, depending on the problem at hand.

The primary advantage of this technique is that it can significantly reduce the time complexity of a problem. For instance, in problems where you might need to find a pair of elements that meet a certain condition, a naive approach might involve nested loops, resulting in a time complexity of O(n^2). However, by using the two pointers technique, you can often reduce this to O(n).

Here's a simple example in Python:

```python
def two_sum(nums, target):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    while left < right:
        current_sum = nums[left] + nums[right]
        if current_sum == target:
            return [left, right]
        elif current_sum < target:
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    return []
```

In this example, we're using the two pointers technique to find two numbers in a ascending-sorted array that add up to a given target. The left pointer starts at the beginning of the array, and the right pointer starts at the end. We then move the pointers towards each other until we find a pair of numbers that add up to the target, or until the pointers meet.
