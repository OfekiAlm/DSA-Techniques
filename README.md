# DSA Techniques
Welcome to our open-source project on Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)! This is a place for anyone interested in learning about DSA, from beginners to those looking to brush up on their skills. We're building a collection of easy-to-understand guides and examples that cover various DSA topics, like the two pointers technique, sliding window algorithm, and many more.

## Project Structure
This repository contains a folder for each technique, in the dedicated folder you can find a Markdown (.md) files that cover a wide range of topics related to DSA. Each file is dedicated to a specific concept or technique, providing explanations, examples, and potentially, implementation details.

## How to Use This Repository
- **Learning**: Navigate through the files to learn about different DSA concepts. Each file is structured to start with basic explanations and gradually delve into more complex examples.
- **Discussion**: Use the Issues section for discussions, suggestions, or queries related to DSA topics.
