# Slow&Fast Pointers
Slow and Fast pointers is a technique used in linked lists to solve a variety of problems. The idea is to have two pointers, one that moves at a slow pace (usually one step at a time) and another that moves at a fast pace (usually two steps at a time). This technique is particularly useful in identifying cycles in a linked list, finding the middle element, and so on.
