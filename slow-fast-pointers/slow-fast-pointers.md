# Slow&Fast Pointers
Slow and Fast pointers is a technique used in linked lists to solve a variety of problems. The idea is to have two pointers, one that moves at a slow pace (usually one step at a time) and another that moves at a fast pace (usually two steps at a time). This technique is particularly useful in identifying cycles in a linked list, finding the middle element, and so on.

Let's consider the problem of detecting a cycle in a linked list. The problem statement is as follows: Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

Here's how we can solve this problem using the slow and fast pointers technique in Python:

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.next = None

class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: ListNode) -> bool:
        if not head or not head.next:
            return False

        slow = head
        fast = head.next

        while slow != fast:
            if not fast or not fast.next:
                return False
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next

        return True
```

In this code, we first check if the list is empty or has only one node. If so, we return False as there can't be a cycle. Then we initialize our slow and fast pointers to the head of the list and the second node respectively. We then enter a loop where we move slow one step at a time and fast two steps at a time. If at any point slow and fast meet, we return True indicating a cycle. If fast reaches the end of the list, we return False indicating no cycle.

This technique works because if there is a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually catch up to the slow pointer. If there is no cycle, the fast pointer will reach the end of the list.
